## Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. 
## It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.
## Naive Bayes uses a similar method to predict the probability of different class based on various attributes. 
## This algorithm is mostly used in text classification and with problems having multiple classes
