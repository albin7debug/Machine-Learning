####  Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable.
#### The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.
#### In simple words, the dependent variable is binary in nature having data coded as either 1 (stands for success/yes) or 0 (stands for failure/no).
#### Mathematically, a logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.
#### It is one of the simplest ML algorithms that can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection, Diabetes prediction, cancer detection etc.
